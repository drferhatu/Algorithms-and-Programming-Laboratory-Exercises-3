# Python Turtle Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises designed to enhance your algorithmic skills using the Python Turtle library.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises involve drawing various geometric patterns. 
Each exercise description outlines the specific pattern to be created and the algorithmic challenges involved.

1.  **Drawing a Star:**
    * Design an algorithm to draw a five-pointed star.
    * Calculate the angle and line length correctly.

2.  **Drawing a Spiral Square:**
    * Design an algorithm to draw a spiral square with increasing side lengths.
    * Determine how to change the turtle's turning angle and movement distance after each square.

3.  **Drawing Nested Polygons:**
    * Design an algorithm to draw nested polygons with the same center and number of sides.
    * Figure out how to adjust the size of each polygon and position the turtle while drawing.

4.  **Drawing a Colorful Spiral:**
    * Design an algorithm to draw a spiral using different colors.
    * Decide how to change the color at each step and create the spiral shape.

5.  **Drawing a Random Pattern:**
    * Design an algorithm to create an interesting pattern by randomly changing the turtle's movements and properties (color, thickness, etc.).
    * Explore how to use randomness and vary different parameters.

## Code Structure

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file with the exercises and their corresponding Python code cells for your solutions.

Enjoy improving your algorithmic thinking and Python Turtle skills!
